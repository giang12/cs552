// Write your answer to Problem 2 (b) and (c) here
Part B: 

Branch prediction is necesarry and helpful because it improves the performance of the processor
Because r6 is set to 1, branch should not be taken. 
Since the branch prediction is that branch does not happen the nop instruction after branch instruction runs without any stall i.e. when the branch instr. is in 
the decode stage, the nop is in the fetch state.

is we predict the branch is not taken, we do not have to wait for the writeback stage to complete/ or the alu operation to happen.

Part C:

we actually know whether the branch will be taken in the execute stage. So branch prediction can take more than 1 cycle in the case that there is misprediction. In that case, we flush the two instructions (in IF and ID stage).

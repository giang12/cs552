Part B: 

Branch prediction is necesarry and helpful because it improves the performance of the processor

Because r6 is set to 1, branch should not be taken. Since the branch prediction is 
that branch does not happen the nop instruction after branch instruction runs without any stall.

is we predict the branch is not taken, we do not have to wait for the writeback stage to complete 
to write to the Rs register.

branch is taken - 
flush the 2 instructions that have started. (2 cycles wasted)

branch is not taken - 
no cycles wasted



Part C:
it takes 1 cycles always to predict branch since we assume branch is not taken always for any branch instruction
the actual branch destination is calculated in the execute stage.
